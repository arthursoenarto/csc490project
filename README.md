### Location of the dataset: 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

### Reasons, why you decided for this specific dataset (longest section/paragraph of this report, one or two figures will be helpful):

#### Background:

Skin Cancer is one of the most common cancers in North America. The most common cause is from overexposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun. It involves the growth of abnormal cells in the outermost skin layer (called the epidermis), which can form malignant tumors if not treated early. Since it grows in the outermost layer, this property makes skin cancer easily detectable and extremely relevant to camera based machine learning applications, which is the motivation for our project.

#### Dataset:

The Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset contains dermatoscopic (examination of skin lesions) images from different populations. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes. 

##### Variety:

The most important reason we chose this dataset is because it contains variable data that is representative of the real world. For example, the dataset contains image samples from over 15 different locations across the patients bodies, image samples include both genders, and contain different skin shades. Having a dataset with various different types of samples is important because it will allow the model to generalize to the real world and prevent it from being biased towards a specific sample of the population.
